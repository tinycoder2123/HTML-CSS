                    Python is a widely used high-level programming language created by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> in the late 1980's. The language places strong emphasis on code readability and simplicity, making it possible for programmers to develop applications rapidly.

               <h3>How Does Python Fit into Web Development?</h3>
          <p>
                    Python can be used to build server-side web applications. While a web framework is not required to build web apps, it's rare that developers would not use existing open source libraries to speed up their progress in getting their application working.

               <h3>Why Python is Great</h3>
          <p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Code written for Python Software development is easy to read and you can grasp a lot out of it just by looking at it -- no more curly braces and code blocks.</li>
                    <li>Its standard library support enables you to execute a lot of complex functionalities easily.</li>
                    <li>It supports multiple systems and platforms</li>
                    <li>It is OOP driven, offers good support for objects, modules, and other reusability machanisms.</li>
                    <li>Python web development with Django framework is super smooth. in fact Django is currently the most famou framework for web development</li>
                    <li>It lets you develop quickly with much lesser code</li>
                    <li>It's scalable and lets you expand even complex applications with ease</li>
                    <li>It provides an in-built testing framework to set debugging time and enable fastest workflows</li>
                    <li>The Python resource library is one of the best among programming languages</li>
                    <li>It integrates easily with other languages</li>
                    <li>It is open source, freely available, and quite stable</li>
               </ul>

               <h3>Why Python is NOT so Great</h3>
          <p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Python has a smaller pool of experienced developers compared to other languages like Java</li>
                    <li>It lacks true multiprocessor support</li>
                    <li>Python is slower in performance than other languages</li>
                    <li>The language isn't a good choice for mobile applications and memorey intensive tasks.</li>
                    <li>It has database access limitations</li>
                    <li>Concurrency and parallelism are not designed in the language for superelegant use</li>
                    <li>Python's one line functions (Lambda's) feel quite limited when it comes to meta programming of the sort popular in LISP</li>
                    <li>The only reason not wanting to learn Python, is that at some point you must learn JavaScript; and when you do, learning Python will seem useless</li>

     <!-- Who Uses Python -->
               <h3>Who uses it? Google Does!</h3>
          <p>
               Python has been an important part of Google from the company's beginning. Python is recognized as an official language at Google, it is one of the key languages at Google today, alongside with C++ and Java. Some of the key Python contributors are Googlers and they continue to use, promote, and support the language actively. Python runs on many Google internal systems and shows up in many of Google APIs. It suits perfectly the engineering process at Google. "Python has been an imrtant part of Google since the beginning, and remains so as the sytem grows and evolves. Today dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we're looking for more people with skills in this language" (Peter Norvig, director of search quality at Google, Inc.).
               <br>
               Google has a strong relationship with the language itself and the Python software foundation: Google is always sponsoring various Python conferences (PyCon, EuroPython, etc).
